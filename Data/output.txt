Once you join the server, our bot, Aaronchetan will send you a DM asking you to connect your µ-ID, which is provided in the µlearn profile. Once it’s connected, you can start your onboarding process.
Now you will have access to the #lvl1-info channel, and as you do the tasks, you will progress through the levels. Once you reach level 4, you will have the option to edit Interest Groups on your µlearn profile page.

A graduate in Electrical and Electronics Engineering fromTrinity College of Engineering Thiruvananthapuram, Amrithajoined the GTech 𝝁Learn platform through the college placementcell, with the intent of receiving a good opportunity to developexcellent leadership and team management skills. Interestinglythis platform was also her first time interacting with herco-campus ambassadors from the same college.She, along with her co-campus ambassadors, utilized the onlinemeeting platforms that became widely popular with the advent ofthe COVID-19 lockdown to connect with their collegemates. Viaonline sessions, they were able to discuss what 𝝁Learn stood forand what they could gain by being a part of this community, andget them onboarded on to the 𝝁Learn Discord platform.She and her team were able to pique the interest of the majorityin a college consisting of approximately 400 students.Althoughthey noticed that the activity had reduced post the onboardingstage, her team was successful in motivating their peers toactively participate, steering them to the top position in thecollege leaderboard.Her college still stands as one of thetop - performing colleges among the 200 + onboarded across thestate.Amritha joined the platform as a learner and was shortlynominated as one of the student ambassadors of her college.Shehas then gone ahead to take up roles of a district lead and amoderator and also grabbed an internship opportunity with𝝁Learn. Her contributions to the community helped her attain thetop performer award of the GTech 𝝁Learn community during thekick-start of 𝝁Learn 2.0.She believes that to create an impact, all you need to do istake initiative, step out of your comfort zone and have faith inyourself.With her having completed over a year of the studentambassador journey and currently pursuing higher education, shestill intends to continue contributing to the community and helpevery individual who struggles in their professional journey.

A graduate of Computer Science and Engineering from St. Joseph’s College of Engineering and Technology, Palai,Sandra currently works at South Indian Bank's digital and technology division. Being an enthusiast about communityinvolvement and also being part of a couple of communities, it was only natural that Sandra took a step ahead intothe µLearn community as well, to see what it offered her. She took the stride in her fourth year of college to joinµLearn as a campus ambassador. Right from the first interaction she had with this community, Sandra realised theimportance of the µLearn platform and believed it to be a place where she could acquire more learning than a college could offer.Sandra’s active involvement in several meetings and the community in general, along with her strong communicationskills earned her the confidence of the people she worked with, which led to her appointment as the µLearn Kottayamdistrict head. She gained a lot of knowledge, developed her organisational skills, and made connections with many wonderfulmembers of the community while serving as the district head.With her college harbouring multiple communities already, it was not easy to introduce them to yet another community and presentits unique value.But she succeeded to get through the challenges with the help of her team, the placement cell and college mentors,and a campus chapter of µLearn was established in her college. An introductory class for each year and MCA was initially created, whichgreatly aided in the growth of the community.Her efforts helped the students bridge their skill gaps, identify their actual potential and interests, and understand the value ofgoing beyond the boundaries of the college curriculum.Due to the enrollment of a large number of students in the µLearn Discordplatform and their active engagement, her institution was awarded the position of the top - performing college for the academic year2021–2022 by Sri K N Balagopal, Kerala's honourable finance minister.Alongside the district head stint, she also worked as an intern for the YIP Program organized by K-DISC and was given theresponsibility of serving as the program's state lead. Now exposed to a broader avenue, she had the opportunity to teachstudents at various colleges and introduce them to new things while being an intern. This boosted her confidence, enhancingher organisational, communication, and leadership skills which helped her thrive in her job interviews. Working with µLearnmade her well-equipped to handle challenging questions in interviews.What we will face in the workplace is very different from what we learn in college. Theory and application are definitely two, and joining learning communities gives you a head start in being industry-ready. µLearn is one such community which definitely helps you become industry-ready and land your dream job.- Sandra Pramod
