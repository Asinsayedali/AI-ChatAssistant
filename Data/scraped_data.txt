I have a deep sense of gratitude for being selected by L&T Technology Services through ASAP Kerala’s ASPIRE 2023 placement programme. The overall process was meticulously planned and I received exceptional direction and assistance from ASAP Kerala’s placement division. I extend my heartfelt thanks and appreciation to the people involved in ASAP Kerala’s – AI/ML course for their valuable knowledge and support. My sincere acknowledgement goes to the ASAP team for presenting young minds with this remarkable course, along with scholarship support. Most importantly, all thanks to the people working under the ASAP placement team for their commitments and arranging the placement drive with an extensive range of companies. The support ASAP’s placement team gave me during all the stages of placement was of great help. To put it simply, they want you to get placed at a reputed company more than you do! Choosing to become an ASAP student was truly the best decision I’ve ever made.
I’m extremely grateful to ASAP Kerala for conducting ASPIRE 2023. ASPIRE 2023 opened several doors to various opportunities, and along with the placements offered, they opened a door to my dreams.
I’m incredibly thankful for the opportunities provided by ASPIRE 2023, which is the reason I got a chance to screen through several recruiters and apply for roles relevant to me. All this led to getting placed at a reputable company! ASAP’s placement team really opened new doors to my dreams, and for that, I’m so grateful.
The academic structure and support offered by ASAP Kerala have been encouraging. ASAP Kerala and its instructors have always created a welcoming environment for us, motivating us to scale new heights. My six-month banking course with ASAP Kerala was insightful. The good news is that the organisation also helps students with placements, which enabled us to land jobs of our choice. I am grateful to ASAP Kerala for assisting me in getting placed with Dhanalaxmi Bank as a Junior Officer. I sincerely recommend the courses offered by ASAP Kerala to anyone looking for work.
I sincerely appreciate the ASAP Kerala team for being supportive all through my placement journey. With the timely guidance of ASAP Kerala professionals, I managed to get placed with UST. I thank the
entire team for all the support.
 
 
 
I am a Computer Science Engineering graduate, and ASAP Kerala offered me a training opportunity in the Service Now course. The entire training team curated the programme meticulously. Though it was an online course, the sessions and study material assisted me in successfully completing my training. ASAP Kerala’s Placement Portal is an amazing platform for freshers to connect with job providers. I highly recommend the skill courses offered by ASAP Kerala to all my friends.
I always aspired to  be a cybersecurity engineer. I fulfilled this by completing a six-month cyber security course provided by ASAP Kerala. ASAP Kerala offered a lot of placement opportunities as well. I am thankful to all the people behind this great community for providing me with continuous guidance and opportunities. I recommended all my friends to enroll in the courses offered by ASAP Kerala and register with their placement portal.
” I always wished to get placed with a famed MNC, and through ASAP Kerala, I was able to fulfill it. The ‘AWS Cloud Foundation’ course offered the appropriate skill sets expected by the industry. ASAP was also an eye-opener that CGPA is not the only prerequisite that mattered for placements, but holistic grooming. Today, as I work with Wipro as a Project Engineer, I can’t thank ASAP Kerala enough for paving the way”
” I feel blessed to be offered placement opportunities by three leading MNCs — Wipro, TCS, IBS Software Pvt. Ltd. — evenduring the pandemic. I’m currently pursuing my BTech CSE(final year). All these opportunities came my way through the AWS Cloud Programme course offered by ASAP Kerala. I’m thankful to ASAP Kerala for being a part of my achievements. ”
 
 
I am glad to have been a part of the ‘Connect to Children’ programme run by ASAP Kerala and Kudumbashree. I was fearful of expressing myself in front of others but after having attended the classes, I’ve developed self-confidence to express my thoughts and learned a lot about the English language. It will be great if ASAP Kerala could conduct similar sessions in the future as well, of which I’d like to be a part of.
I wish to thank the ASAP Kerala team and the trainers who put together a well-thought-out course on GST. I thoroughly enjoyed the format it was presented in. The classes were detailed and well-structured.  The activities given during the class, like quizzes and presentations, were informative. Being a finance aspirant, I believe opting for the ‘GST Accounts Assistant’ course was a wise decision.
It’s never easy to stay ahead of new skills and technological information. It always involves some form of training and resource assistance. The AWS Cloud Foundation course underASAP Kerala provided me with an opportunity to learn and gain industry-demanding skills. This also helped me to get placed with WIPRO. Getting placed with a reputed firm even before the completion of the course is like dreaming with eyes open. I thank ASAP Kerala for facilitating this.
Rather than becoming tech colonies, Keralites should strive to be the inventors and developers of technology. Technological development should be used to address the issues faced by farmers, fishermen and weavers for improving the lives of the people is what he emphasised. The state is focusing on the developments of all the segments. The internet has brought about new possibilities in research. The youth can bring revolutionary changes through three stages viz., update, enhance and benchmark.
ASAP Kerala is involved in strengthening an industry-led and demand-based skill training ecosystem in the state creating synergic partnerships with stakeholders in skill development at the national level.
